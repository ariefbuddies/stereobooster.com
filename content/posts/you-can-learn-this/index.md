Obviously, any skill is learnable, nobody borns with skillset. But there are some skills which seem to be natural, some skills that are never taught in school and university, some skills which you never thought can be learned.

For example, positive thinking, joking, etc. Would you think that this something teachable or learnable?

When I say teachable, I mean some effective, systematic approach. And not random poking around for 10000 hours (Malcolm Gladwell style).

**Do you know any skills that are commonly not considered as learnable, yet there are courses or books to learn them?**

For example can learn this:

- [The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being/home/welcome)
- How to joke. I guess you can learn it from the book: "What Are You Laughing At?: A Comprehensive Guide to the Comedic Event"
